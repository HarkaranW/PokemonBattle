# PokemonBattle

A turn-based Pokemon battle simulator that recreates the classic Pokemon battle experience in a web browser.

## About This Project

PokemonBattle is a fan-made project that simulates Pokemon battles with accurate game mechanics, including type advantages, moves, and battle strategies. Players can engage in exciting turn-based combat with their favorite Pokemon characters.

## Purpose

This project was developed as an assignment for my Game Programming class. The assignment required us to:
- Create a turn-based battle system with working game mechanics
- Implement object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript
- Design and manage complex game states
- Build an interactive user interface
- Apply game development principles learned in class

## Features

- Turn-based battle system
- Multiple Pokemon with unique stats and abilities
- Type effectiveness system (Fire beats Grass, Water beats Fire, etc.)
- Move selection and damage calculation
- HP tracking and battle outcomes
- Interactive battle interface

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** - Core game logic and mechanics
- **HTML/CSS** - User interface and styling
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Pokemon and battle system architecture

## Context

This battle simulator was created as an assignment for my Game Programming class. The project let me combine my interest in Pokemon with the technical challenges of implementing a turn-based battle system. It was rewarding to recreate the mechanics I enjoyed as a player and understand how they work from a programming perspective. The assignment emphasized proper use of classes and objects to represent Pokemon and battle logic.

## Game Mechanics

The battle system includes:
- Accurate damage calculation based on Pokemon stats
- Type effectiveness multipliers
- Critical hit system
- Multiple moves per Pokemon
- Turn-based strategy gameplay
- Pokemon level up feature

## What I Learned

- Designing and implementing class hierarchies
- Managing complex game state across turns
- Creating reusable and maintainable code
- Implementing battle algorithms and formulas
- Building interactive web applications
- Debugging complex logic flows
